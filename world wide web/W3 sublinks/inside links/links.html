    <title>Hypertext Terms</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hypertext Terms</h1>
    <p>this is glossary of terms within the <a href="../W3.html">WorldWideWeb</a> project. In most cases, their use corresponds to convertional use in hypertext circles</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a name="Anchor">Anchor</a></dt>
        <dd>An area whitin a the content of a <a name="1" href="#Node">node</a> which is the source or destination of a <a href="#Link">link</a> . The anchor may be the whole of the node content. Typically, clicking a mouse on an anchor area causes the link to be followed, leaving the anchor ar the opposite end of the link displayed. Anchors tend to be highlighted in a special way (always, or when the mouse is over them), or represented by a special symbol. An anchor may, often does, correspond to the whole node. (alos sometimes known as "span", "region", "button", or "extent").</dd>
        <dt>Annotation</dt>
        <dd>The linking of a new commentary <a href="#Node">node</a> to an existing node. If readers can annotate nodes, then they can immediately provide feedback if the information is misleading,out of date or plain wrong. thus the quality of the information in the <a href="">web</a> can be improved. <a href="">(More...)</a></dd>
        <dt>Authoring</dt>
        <dd>A term for the process of writing a document. "Authoring" seems to have come into use in order to emphasise that document production involved more than just writing.</dd>
        <dt>Back link</dt>
        <dd>A link in one direction implied from the existence of an explict limk in the other direction. See: <a href="">Building back-links</a></dd>
        <dt>Browser</dt>
        <dd>A program which allows a <a href="">person</a> to read <a href="">hypertext</a> . The browser gives some means of viewing the contents of <a href="#Node">nodes</a> , and of <a href="">navigating</a> from one node to another</dd>
        <dt>Button</dt>
        <dd>An <a href="">anchor</a> which is the source of a <a href="#Link">link</a> . Often, but not always, represented on screen to look like a push-button.</dd>
        <dt>Card</dt>
        <dd>An alternative term for a <a href="#Node">node</a> in a system (e.g. HyperCard, Notecards) in which the node size is limited to single page of limited size.</dd>
        <dt>Client</dt>
        <dd>Aprogram which requests services of another program. Normally, the <a href="">browser</a> is a client of a data server.</dd>
        <dt>Database</dt>
        <dd>We have used this vaguely as aterm for a collection of <a href="#Node">nodes</a> . We imagine management information for one of these being kept in one place and all being accessible by the same <a href="">server</a> . <a href="#Link">Links</a> outside this are "external", and those inside are "internal". We do not imply anything about how the information shored be stored.</dd>
        <dt>Daemon</dt>
        <dd>A program which runs independently of, for example the <a href="">browser</a> . Daemons may perform various management tasks such as <a href="">building indexes</a> , ovrviews and <a href="">back-links</a> . Under unix, "daemon" is used for "<a href="">server</a>", because servers normally run independently.</dd>
        <dt>Document</dt>
        <dd>A term for a <a href="#Node">node</a> on some systems (eg Intermedia). Sometimes used by others as a term for a collection of nodes on related topics, possible stored or distributed as one. the prefered term in W3 documentation.</dd>
        <dt>Domain</dt>
        <dd>We have used this specifically for a unit of protection. it could possibly correspond to a <a href="">database</a> ,  and in that case would be a better (less vague) term for it.</dd>
        <dt>External</dt>
        <dd>A <a href="#Link">link</a> to a <a href="#Node">node</a> in a different database. See <a href="">Database</a></dd>
        <dt>Host</dt>
        <dd>A computer on a network. We use this term rather than the term "<a href="#Node">node</a>" which is oftem used for a document in a hypertext <a href="">web</a> .</dd>
        <dt>Hypermedia</dt>
        <dd>MultiMedia <a href="">Hypertext</a> . HyperMedia and HyperText tend to be used loosely in place of each other. Media other than text typicallyinclude graphics, sound, and video. (<a href="">More</a>).</dd>
        <dt>Hypertext</dt>
        <dd>Text which is not constrained to be a linear. (<a href="">More...</a>)</dd>
        <dt>Index</dt>
        <dd>Something which points at other data; a serverfacility which provides pointers to particular data as a function of a query; a tableof contents of a book in hypertext form. (<a href="">More</a>).</dd>
        <dt>Internal</dt>
        <dd>A <a href="">link</a> to a <a href="#Node">node</a> in the same <a href="">database</a> . See <a href="">database</a> .</dd>
        <dt>Link</dt>
        <dd>A relationship between two <a href="">anchors</a>, stored in the same or different <a href="">database</a> . see <a href="">"internals"</a> and <a href="">"External"</a> .</dd>
        <dt>Navigation</dt>
        <dd>The process of moving from one <a href="#Node">node</a> to another through the hypertext <a href="">web</a> . this is normally done by following <a href="#Link">links</a> . various features of a particular <a href="">browser</a>may make this easier. these incluce keeping a history of where the user has been, and drawing diagrams of links between nearby nodes. (<a href="">More...</a>).</dd>
        <dt><a name="Node">Node</a></dt>
        <dd>A unit of information. also known as a frame(KWS), card (Hypercard, notecards). used with this special meaning in hypertext circles: do not sonfuse with "node" meaning "network host". for user's benefits, we use the term "<a href="">document</a>" as this is the nearest term outside the hypertext world.</dd>
        <dt>Protection</dt>
        <dd>The prevention of unauthorised users from reading, or writing, a particular piece of data. alos known as "authentication", "access control", etc.(<a href="">More...</a>).</dd>
        <dt>Path</dt>
        <dd>An ordered set of nodes or anchors which represent a sequence in which a <a href="">web</a> can be read. a path may represent the sequence a reader actully used, or may be a sequence recommened to the reader by the author.</dd>
        <dt>Reader</dt>
        <dd>We have used this term for the person who browses, to distinguish him/her from the program (<a href="">browser</a>) which(s) he uses.</dd>
        <dt>Server</dt>
        <dd>A program which provides a service to another known as the <a href="">client</a> . in a <a href="">hypertext</a> system, a server will provide hypertext information to a <a href="">browser</a> . See also: <a href="">daemon</a> .</dd>
        <dt>Tracing</dt>
        <dd>The automatic finding of nodes by automatic <a href="">navigation</a> . examples might be finding all nodes dependent on another node, all people interested in a given node, all modules which use a given module. another example is a trace starting with more than one node, such as to find a node in common between two groups, or path linking two nodes.</dd>
        <dt>Topology</dt>
        <dd>The allowable connectivity between nodes, anchors and links: for example, 1-1 or many -1 mappings. (<a href="">More...</a>).</dd>
        <dt>Versioning</dt>
        <dd>The storage and management of previous versions of a piece of information, for security, diagnostics, and interset. this is important when many users are allowed to edit the same material. (<a href="">More...</a>).</dd>
        <dt>Web</dt>
        <dd>A set of <a href="#Node">nodes</a> interconnected by <a href="#Link">links</a> . Often, the set of all the nodes which are interconnected. see also <a href="">Topology</a> .</dd>
